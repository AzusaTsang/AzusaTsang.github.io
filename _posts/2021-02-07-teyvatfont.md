There are many different languages in Teyvat. Most of them based on real-world languages

## Teyvat Language

It's the written language used by all the nations of Teyvat to communicate with each other, much like English is in the real world. The letters are seemingly inspired upside-down mirrored Latin lettersâ€”although not all. Apparently, unlike English, there is no capitalization nor punctuation.

<p>
This language can be found in Domains, locked chests (ones with red circles around them), and certain Investigation points. Like the common written language, it's based on Latin letters, but unlike the common one, the words and grammar are actually based on Classical Latin. Although there is no capitalization, there is punctuation.
<br>
The phrases seen in Domains currently have unknown meaning and do not translate into any intelligible Latin phrases. Ones at Investigation points have the following words inscribed: "fortunae," "sine," "mixture," and "ingenium," in no particular order.
<br>
The unknown language can also be seen in the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview, used to write Latin phrases for each nation's story theme. Since Dainsleif is the narrator and he is from Khaenri'ah, the unknown language may be Khaenri'ah's written language.
